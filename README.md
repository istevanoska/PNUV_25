# Mental Health 

This project is a static **“About Us”** web page dedicated to promoting mental health awareness among children and young people.  
The content is inspired by the **HBSC study (Health Behaviour in School-aged Children)**, an international collaborative study conducted in partnership with the **World Health Organization (WHO)**.

The page is designed to be visually calming, informative, and accessible, with a modern UI and smooth user experience.
